* LRUG is a London-based community for anyone who is interested in the Ruby programming language
* LRUG provides [online](http://lrug.org/mailing-list) and [offline](http://lanyrd.com/series/lrug/) opportunities to:
    * discuss Ruby and related topics
    * socialise with friendly people who are interested in Ruby
    * find or fill Ruby-related jobs
* we want to be a diverse and inclusive community, united by an interest in Ruby…
* …so we want anyone who is interested in Ruby to participate
* it’s of primary importance that everyone who wants to participate feels safe and welcome
    * (if you’ve behaved badly elsewhere, that may count against you here because of the effect it has on other people)
* as a participant in LRUG, you should:
    * behave respectfully towards other people and consider their feelings
    * contribute positively and constructively to discussions
        * we want a high signal-to-noise ratio
        * joining an annoying conversation will cause it to escalate, but ignoring it will kill it off
* all LRUG participants are accountable for their own behaviour
* please report any inappropriate or harmful behaviour to:

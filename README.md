# LRUG is a London-based community for anyone who is interested in the Ruby programming language

LRUG provides [online](http://lrug.org/mailing-list) and [offline](http://lanyrd.com/series/lrug/) opportunities to:
 * discuss Ruby and related topics
 * socialise with friendly people who are interested in Ruby
 * find or fill Ruby-related jobs

We want LRUG to be a diverse and inclusive community, united by an interest in Ruby and so we want anyone who is interested in Ruby to be able to participate.  It’s of primary importance that everyone who wants to participate feels safe and welcome.

## Code of Conduct

As a participant in LRUG, you should:
 * behave respectfully towards other people — they’re real humans, just like you
 * be considerate of people’s time and attention
 * contribute positively and constructively to discussions (online or in-person)

We want a high signal-to-noise ratio and expect you to: 
 * Lead by example - If a discussion is devolving into snark and name-calling, either let it die or raise the tone.
 * Keep standards high - If someone acts out of line, make that crystal clear to them.

All LRUG participants are accountable for their own behaviour.  If you’ve behaved badly elsewhere, that may count against you here because of the effect it has on other people.

Please report any inappropriate or harmful behaviour to:
 * [Aanand](http://aanandprasad.com/) ([@aanand](http://twitter.com/aanand), [aanand.prasad@gmail.com](mailto:aanand.prasad@gmail.com))
